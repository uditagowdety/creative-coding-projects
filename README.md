# 🎨 creative coding projects inspired by the coding train!

welcome! 👋 this is a collection of my **creative coding** projects built predominantly using the **p5.js** library, inspired by daniel shiffman’s [coding train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) challenges and tutorials. daniel’s work has been a huge influence on my journey in visual and interactive programming since i was in middle school! i love exploring how code can create beautiful, unexpected art.

## 🖼️ projects

here are a few of the future explorations in generative art, simulations, and algorithmic designs i'll be working on (yet to be published here -- stay tuned!):

- 🌌 **particle systems**: an experiment in simulating particle behaviors, inspired by daniel’s particle tutorials
- 🔄 **fractal trees**: recursive branching and fractals in javascript, with customizable parameters to grow different types of “trees”
- 💡 **perlin noise flow field**: using perlin noise to generate complex, organic patterns and visualize randomness
- 🌊 **water ripple simulation**: a dynamic water ripple effect, experimenting with wave physics and interaction
- ✨ **metaballs and blending**: simulating fluid shapes that blend and merge, inspired by metaball physics
